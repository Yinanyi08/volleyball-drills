Keep the back tall and bend the knees to dip slightly at the hips before explosively pushing both feet into the floor and snapping the hips forward to punch both arms straight into the air. As the arms reach full extension, stand straight up. Slowly lower both weights by pulling the elbows down to the rib cage to bring the kettlebells back to the original racked position on the chest and shoulders."

Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and \"brace\" (engage your abdominal / core muscles) to stiffen your spine.",

Keep your head facing forward or to the floor, and position your arms where comfortable or where they offer the greatest degree of balance support.",

Hip Extension: Slowly extend your left hip (raise and straighten the knee) attempting to extend it until it is at, or near parallel, to the floor without any rotation in the hip. Your goal is to keep both hips parallel to the floor.
